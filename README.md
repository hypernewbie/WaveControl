  Cycling game backend, containing BLE sensor device communications and trainer control, route loading, recording and simulation features. Only BLE is supported, no Ant+ stack.  Console demo program included!  While you can ride this fine as-is with the console demo program, this is intended to be used as a backend for a game engine frontend, such as Unity / Unreal engine, which will take care of the nice UI and graphics and user experience.
